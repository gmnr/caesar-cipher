# Caesar-Cipher
A commandline tool that allows you to decrypt messages using the Ceasar Cipher

# Usage
There are 3 different ways to use the cipher:

1 - Run the script and get prompts to select the "KEY" and the "MESSAGE" to encrypt.

2 - Run the script from the command line and use the flag '-k' to change directly the encyption key. You'll be prompted to insert a message.

3 - Run the script from the command line with the flag '-p' and get prompted to select a txt file that will be read and encrypted.
